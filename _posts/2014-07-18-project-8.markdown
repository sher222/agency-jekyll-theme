As part of Stanford's Empirical Security Research Group, I have been working on a project analyzing the Chrome Web store. My mentor for this project is Prof. Aurore Fass. 

I first built my own Chrome extension using html and javascript to monitor other extensions a given user had installed. My extension could intercept messages, DOM changes, and fetch requests and then pass this information to a Django backend.

In addition, I built a multithreaded crawler in Python to scrape metadata from the Chrome Web store as well as download source code every time an extension was updated. The metadata was then stored in a SQL server.

The majority of this project has consisted of data analysis. Using matplotlib, I have made many graphs detailing different variables such as that displayed below.



<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="img/portfolio/chrome/percent_updated_scatter.png" alt="sample graph" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%;" class="post_image"/>
<p style="margin-top: -8px;">This plot shows the percent of extensions that have been updated at least once by their xth month in the Chrome Web Store.</p>

This research project is still a work in the progress and will hopefully result in a conference publication in the near future.
