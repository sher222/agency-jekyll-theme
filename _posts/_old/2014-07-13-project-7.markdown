As a Christmas gift to my family, I decided to create a program that sends a email every day with a family photo and inspirational quote. This is definitely a family favorite and one of the few gifts that hasn't been put away in a closet and forget about.

To do this, I created a Python script that was run on a Raspberry Pi. I loaded a folder full of images onto the Pi. I then used smtplib to send emails and used BeautifulSoup to scrape Brainy Quote's quote of the day. An email with a randomly selected family photo and quote was then promptly delivered to each family member's inbox.

I used crontab on the Raspberry Pi to automate running the script at noon every day.
